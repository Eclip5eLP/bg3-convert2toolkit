# bg3-lsx2tbl-converter
Convert LSX to TBL files

run ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` to install the required libraries.

Put all files you want to convert into the folder of the script or vice versa and run it.

If you get an error when converting:
  The file format is either not lsx or its a format I havent made compatible yet.
If you get an error after conversion inside the toolkit:
  Post your toolkit error so I can fix it, this means some entry used a different data type than the usual ones.
